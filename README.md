# Python Challenges
This repo contains a simple project for developing and test python solutions to a set of coding challenges.
This project  requires `poetry` to be installed on your machine.

## Quick Start
1. Install requirements:

`poetry install`

2. Start a shell with the projects working environment set up:

`poetry shell`

This will activate the virtual environment for this project.


## Running Tests

You can run a one of test using pytest by simply typing `pytest` in the project root. This will run all the
tests in your project. If you want to run individual test cases check the pytest documentation. If you
don't want to keep typing this command each time you make a change to your code, you can use pytest-watch
by typing `ptw` at the terminal in the project root. Again, this will run all the tests in your project. For
details on pytest-watch, you can check the pytest-watch documentation.
